A web app that lets you play music and control a Pomodoro timer.

## Brainstorming / planning

- Use spotify api to play music
- maybe let user crud playlists embedded from youtube <- most likely
- control a pomodoro timer 
- set timer lengths, start stop, notifications? 
- keep up with sessions completed
- Make account and store sessions and remember playlists
- custom icons for playlists

## Technologies

- React, Vite, Jsx
- Express, Node
- maybe look into BlueprintJS for UI or stick with Bootstrap since familiar

## Development Process

Since this is a simple tool I decided to use [excalidraw ](https://excalidraw.com/) to mockup the design
